00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
...trying to be competitive and entertaining, it's not easy, it's not,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.700
because...you, when you act [bizarre noises] start doing stuff like that it's kinda hard to play the game

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.680
and win, so you start getting upset because you don't win

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.840
Well I'm at the NA LCS Finals right now with coverage presented by Omnislash

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.060
joined by Tyler1, I never knew if I'd have a chance to interview you ever

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.840
Yeah, I'm...I'm here now, yes you can interview me

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.880
Very good, yeah, I can handle the microphone,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.780
I appreciate, I appreciate the assistance though, it gets kinda heavy so I'm glad

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.700
Uh, and I also appreciate Riot Games, they loaned me a soapbox

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.520
so that I could stand up

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.320
Cause otherwise I'd just, I'd be way down here, yeah

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.160
Yeah, I know, short guy, it's ok we're all short, well not me, but

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.620
Yes, exactly, exactly

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.140
So I'm glad we were able to figure that out

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.660
What do you think of this event?

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.440
Like, this is your first time coming out to one of these things, I think, right?

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.840
Yeah, this is my first time going to any League of Legends-related event

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.280
I mean, Riot Games, huge company, they can definitely do better.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.140
Ok? I mean, they get paid way too much money to be making an event this mediocre

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.340
That being said, they are the best at what they do do

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.500
I mean, not a lot of teams do it, but, I do think this is one of the better ones

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.660
the only one I've ever been to, so I like it

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.280
I'm having fun, meet a lot of people, it's a good time.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.060
Was there a thought, cause...why this one, why come out to this one

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.680
Cause you've had other opportunities I'm sure you could have gone to PAX or you could have gone to Spring Finals, etc.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.460
But it's the Finals, and we get to see Double...I mean, I'm not a...

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.040
me and Doubles, we have our moments I mean, I am better than him,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.120
but it's because it's the Finals of the NA, it's not it's some regular week season 1

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.860
there's a lot of hype, the environment's...everyone's excited, the crowd

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.280
You've been out in the crowd? "Woooooo!" Everybody "Yeah yeah yeah!"

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.400
Everybody getting hype out there, that's awesome

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.680
And you might not see that in like a week 1 game

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.500
People, like, falling asleep in the crowd, so, that's why.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.740
That's why this one.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.740
So you certainly don't sound like a fan, but maybe it's fun for you to come and see

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.680
some of the players that are trying to reach your level of competitiveness,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.420
are there any players that you respect more for, you know, trying to reach up to your level?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.160
Yeah, I, again, Doublelift, I only really, I like, I like botlanes,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.040
so, Doublelift, Sneaky, I like...Zezayl?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.740
Zeyzal

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.840
Zeyzal, I like him a lot, I think he's really...I don't normally talk about this, I think he's really underrated

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.260
I think he's really good, I get him in solo-queue a lot, I think he is a very good player

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.660
Yeah, he's pretty break-out. What...let me ask you this.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.780
There are a lot of people who say to themselves, "When is Tyler1 going to make his LCS debut?"

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.360
People really want to see you compete, and while unfortunately things,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.600
you know, I know the showmatch you were...

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.440
My monitor, dude, my monitor kept flicking on and off and at one point my mouse,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.680
I've never see this before

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.320
it actually came unhooked by itself and flew across the room, I was playing with my keyboard mouse button, the little arrow keys

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.280
I would expect LCS to do better, but I'm sure you don't have those problems at the T1 Invitational?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.040
Not, we never had, we don't have anything like that, and we're also keeping live animals backstage

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.340
while providing top-line equipment, no.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.860
Yeah, there's not yeah, they don't have that here, it's really disappointing

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.620
But, a lot of people do want to see you in the LCS, have you gotten any offers from any teams,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.040
have you had a chance, have you had to turn down anything?

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.980
Ah, a little, an Academy team, a while ago

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.760
now I am, a lot of people know me "Oh, Draven one-trick, Quinn"

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.500
I've actually, I have got to Masters 100 LP without playing Draven

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.700
So, there is improvement, I've been watching a lot of the LCK AD carries,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.420
there's a lot to learn there, dude, there is, there's a lot to learn

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.980
Not so much from the LCS AD carries?

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.540
Nah, I mean, no, they'll say "60 ping" and I just "ha ha ha!" laugh to myself, no

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.260
Cause you were raised on 60 ping I think

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.400
Yeah, I was raised on 98 ping.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.960
98 ping?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.380
Travis, yeah, 98, yeah

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.420
That is...that is extra and that is partly what it's like, you know, just training with, yeah it's an issue

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.260
it's an issue

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.920
I mean, I'm not gonna blame ping, people are, I feel, I don't know how pros do it

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.800
but I, you gotta be passionate about it, you gotta wanna be the best

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.460
and I feel like a lot of these...

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.420
I feel like I'm like flaming these guys now, no offense, I'm not trying to

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.880
No, no, no, they're trying their hardest

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.400
Yeah, I feel like, but I feel like a lot of the lower teams in LCS give up and they don't,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.200
like the players don't actually practice outside of...I mean, I don't know what they do in scrims, or whatever,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.180
cause I play solo-queue a lot, I play more than anybody, I got like 4000 games this season already

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.100
and I play with these players a lot in solo-queue and they don't try their hardest and...

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.620
then they finish last in the standings and they're like "Oh my ping!" Yeah, ping my a...

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.020
Ping your butt

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.280
My behind, yeah

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.880
That's very nice of you, this is a family channel, we're very respectful of people here

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.140
and I know that you are very respectful person, you never swear or cuss, it's a very family stream you run

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.980
You're not wrong, I do not, I wouldn't ever do that

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.540
Stepping back a little bit here, there was a really interesting moment for me, watching up in the audience,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.660
cause I watched the showmatch, and you, I see your clips on Reddit, I see a lot of stuff that gets spread around

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.760
and it feels like at times I worry because it feels like you don't, you're frustrated with League of Legends,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.900
you're frustrated by Riot, and on stage you seemed like you were having so much fun,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.940
I mean, up until Phreak started feeding and then...

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.000
Yeah, he inted me and my bottom-tier LCS two players

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.520
Again, I had Golden Guardians, they're a bottom-tier, I had two bottom-tier LCS players on my team, just saying

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.000
What struck me was you're having so much fun at this thing, it feels like it's actually really good for you

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.300
Yeah, it's because that right...it's solo-queue and then it's playing for fun

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.100
like with other people and having...entertaining, it's like entertaining

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.820
it's not entertaining when you're getting your behind smacked in a solo-queue game

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.840
and you're losing and your teammates are, everybody's not having a good time, or whatever

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.120
but this...I mean everybody's having a good time, the fans were laughing, it was great, that's why

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.320
Is that what drives you more, cause you also seem like a competitive person,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.000
so there's like the competitive side, there's the entertaining side,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.240
what really drives you in the stream and your passion in creating all this content?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.500
I dunno, that's hard

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.720
Before League, it was definitely 100% entertainment

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.560
now, I'm trying to mix that in, where I'm trying to be competitive and entertaining

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.100
It's not easy, it's not

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.340
Because you, when you act [bizarre noises] start doing stuff like that it's kinda hard to play the game

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.420
and win

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.600
so you start getting upset because you don't win

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.300
but, I mean, both I think.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.540
Are there any moments that stand out to you where...

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.420
cause I'm sure there's a lot of people who just wanna root for you to fail, right?

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.280
Cause they see you wig out and then they're like "oh this is hilarious," but

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.320
I think there's a lot of fans out there who are really supportive of you,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.840
I heard you talking to Tyler earlier about the Free Tyler1 signs that, for a while, were actually banned

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.080
but there's a lot of people that support you, are there any moments that stand out to you,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.440
or any interactions where you're like "Oh, actually, that's really supportive, that's really nice"?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.140
Whenever there is...I meet a fan, and it's like a young kid with their parents

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.600
and I meet, the kid's happy, obviously, they're "yeah, nice to meet you," the kid's happy

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.620
and then their parents are in the background, they're...the parents are smiling,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.940
because they know that their kids are happy, that's what really...like that's awesome, that's awesome

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.800
It's really striking meeting and talking to you because it feels like while your stream is oftentimes so much about

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.120
you know, reacting to the moments of defeat, you do seem like a really positive guy who wants to like do positive things

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.380
Yeah, I do, I do, I make people happy, yeah

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.960
Speaking of that, the T1 invitational, really big fan of that

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.500
being at this event, which I know we just discussed, inferior in some ways,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.500
but also has like a live component to it, and there's a lot of fans

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.160
is the thought ever that you would upgrade the T1 audience experience

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.260
so that people can enjoy the high levels of production that you're able to bring to people?

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.940
That's a weird question, that was a wowza, I...what?

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.860
Do you have an audience? Do you want an audience? Do you wanna have a huge amount of people in a giant stadium?

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.780
We could go there, I mean it's possible, yes it is possible

00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:01.360
I feel like the scuffness of it is a big part of why it's so good, so I don't know. Maybe.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.180
I think it'd be fun to see just because,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.880
watching the T1 Invitational reminded me so much of how I started covering League of Legends, right?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.400
They were these online streams, they were people trying to like aspire to create some really fun experience for people

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.740
while doing everything in a lot of cases out of their own home

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.300
so it was just like a really...it was like a callback or cool throwback after like this giant Worlds

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.600
where you see this dragon enter this arena and you're like,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.280
Actually, you don't need all that to have such a good time, so it was really fun for me, I don't know how you feel about all that

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.680
Yeah, we can have both, I feel like if we do both, like we can have both, best of worlds

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.540
put together...nothing will be better, that's actually good, I'm...don't...that's mine now

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.440
Ok, that's yours

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.540
Both, combine 'em both

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.280
It would be really fun if a day before Worlds you guys, you should coordinate with Riot this,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:54.780
the day before Worlds you get the T1 Invitational to sort of like contrast you know the day before, the day after

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.720
Ok, that's, ok we're talking that big, whoa

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.360
The day before at Finals, they broadcast you then the next day you get this other event

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.180
Well that would be an event, you're not wrong

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.780
Uh, other than that, anything that you would say to any of the fans out there, the people that support you,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.500
I'm sure you met a lot of people here

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.860
loltyler1dotcomcodealpha

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.600
loltyler1.com discount code alpha

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.500
Very good, thank you so...

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.520
Hey A squad we live, we out here at the LCS finals, that's me, it's me

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.680
Thank you so much for the interview Tyler1, really appreciate, it's great to meet you in person,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.220
for everyone else, you can check out the rest of my coverage of all things eSports right here on my YouTube channel

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.500
Bye!

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.420
I wanna thank you so much for watching that interview, I really, I gotta say,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.680
I'm doing a specific outro, just for him, Tyler1: super nice guy,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.460
I doubted him in the past, you know, it's fun to watch him rage and all that stuff but I was like

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.080
I dunno, this guy might be a bit of a, bit of a jerk, you know

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.160
that's...that's...you see that sometimes but actually really really nice guy, thank you so much to Tyler

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.480
for doing the interview and hopefully he enjoys the rest of his time playing League of Legends

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.940
I wanna also thank Omnislash so much for their support of my interviews throughout this year,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.740
including Finals in Oakland, they helped cover the costs and make this whole thing happen,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.600
so thanks to them and be sure to check out the description below where I've got stuff in there

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.160
like my Twitch channel, and ways to further support me and some of the content that I make,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.480
all this stuff is in there, again, thanks so much for watching this interview and I just, I really,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.820
I wanted to make this the longest outro that I've ever done before, and I think I've done it,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.240
so thanks so much for sticking through, cause I know a lot of you could turn off the outro at any given point in time,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:39.940
like, this is so long that we can't even stick the follow-me or, you know YouTube next video thing,

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.940
like this is gonna be empty for quite some time in this outro and uh, I mean

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.480
it might be popping up around now, it might have just a second ago, I dunno how these things work,

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:55.080
it just, it happens, but my whole point is, thanks for watching
