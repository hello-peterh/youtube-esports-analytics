00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
It's because Vayne that everybody knows me

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.940
and when I'm using Vayne

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.040
she can make like me more confident than before

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.140
Well it is the first day of groups.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.540
Coverage presented by U.gg

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.500
I'm joined right now by Uzi himself

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.460
as well as Iris who's going to help translate

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.260
Uzi what is it, how important is it for RNG

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:27.255
to come out strong

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.445
in groups after the slow start at MSI

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:33.235
 

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:35.905
 

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:38.875
 

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:41.515
 

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.345
 

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:47.365
 

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:50.165
 

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:51.720
 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.980
So after that we actually tasted the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.495
smell or

00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:00.165
tasted the championship, the world championship

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:03.195
of MSI, so maybe we're getting down to

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.925
get stable and get consistent

00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.480
so we're like heading to the world championshp

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.760
so we are having a better status or having

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.120
a better performance than before

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.200
Now your team, your botlane has prioritized

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.605
Alistar, even though Alistar has

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.225
some counters, why the focus on Alistar?

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:24.195
 

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:26.305
 

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:27.715
 

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:30.115
 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.940
 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.920
 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.480
So, actually we practice it a lot.

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:41.495
So in our team we like this

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:44.335
champion Alistar a lot.

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:47.115
Maybe when we have Alistar on our side

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:50.505
maybe we are a lot more confident than before.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.200
Now, your team once more

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.045
will be facing Gen. G's bot lane

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:58.515
how has that match up changed over the years

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.320
as you have faced Gen G's bot lane over and over again

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.775
 

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:06.785
 

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:09.295
 

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.785
 

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:15.265
 

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:18.085
 

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:21.120
 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.140
So, I think the duo of Gen. G is getting stronger

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.995
because they have been partners for a very long time

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:29.975
and they're getting improvements together

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.945
maybe, they are getting stronger together.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.865
Now Uzi, usually at worlds

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:38.000
we see these videos where they show all the players

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.520
and at the end Faker,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.200
is always the final boss. They show Faker.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.540
But this year Uzi is the final boss.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.500
Uzi walks on stage, in the video at the end

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.375
What does it mean for you to become the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.000
most scary dangerous player at worlds?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.975
 

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:59.805
 

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:03.115
 

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:05.805
 

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:08.395
 

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:11.565
 

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:14.675
 

00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:16.305
 

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:18.185
 

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:21.155
 

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:23.285
 

00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:24.955
 

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:27.925
 

00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:30.985
 

00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:32.695
 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.120
 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.840
Actually I feel a little bit nervous and scared

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.720
cause um

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.795
Because I was acted as the final boss of this Worlds

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.260
so maybe every single team when

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.120
having matched with us they will pay a lot of attention to us

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.520
so we will be like,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.200
get harder or more difficult than before

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.420
to have our game, our victories

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.805
so it will take more time for us to get more preparations.

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:06.435
Now, Uzi in the past when I go to worlds

00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:09.165
similarly, my viewers

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.125
they say "Can you please interview Faker?"

00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:15.205
But now my viewers all wanted me to interview you.

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:17.665
and it feels like RNG

00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:19.920
is getting more and more popular in the west

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.300
Do you think if RNG wins this year

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.720
RNG will become SKT level for western fans

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.200
 

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:32.015
 

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:34.635
 

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:36.815
 

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:38.655
 

00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:41.725
 

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:43.415
 

00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:46.915
 

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:49.735
 

00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:52.355
 

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:55.325
 

00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:57.615
 

00:04:57.615 --> 00:05:00.085
 

00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:03.100
 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.660
So, I don't think that

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.220
we are like

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.580
over SKT cause I do think that SKT is

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.720
a really really strong team

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.380
they're doing a really good job for three world championships

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.035
and they have three throphies.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.940
So I haven't though of the being the western RNG

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.300
or being the western SKT

00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:26.885
because we're trying to but, haven't thought of that

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:29.205
Are there any other

00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:33.120
ADCs at this tournament that you respect or fear?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.205
 

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:38.695
 

00:05:38.935 --> 00:05:41.885
 

00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:45.045
 

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:48.145
 

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:50.515
 

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:53.565
 

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:56.005
 

00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:59.005
 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.840
 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.540
So I actually respect every single AD

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.715
AD players in this worlds

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.740
because, I saw very new things

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.480
in the worlds, like they chose the non-AD carry champions

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.595
in bot lane

00:06:15.595 --> 00:06:18.765
and they're really having a good result in today's matches.

00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:21.675
So I respect all of them, they're getting stronger

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.560
and I think every one of them are scaring me now

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.200
Will we see Uzi play Hiemerdinger?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.560
 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.920
 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.240
I may not use it in this game.

00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:38.145
Last question,

00:06:38.145 --> 00:06:42.180
it was very fun to see the worlds cinematic video

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.035
where you were playing Vayne and you wake up at the end.

00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:48.435
What was it like for you to see yourself in the worlds video?

00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:51.345
 

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:54.175
 

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:55.725
 

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.605
 

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:00.705
 

00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:02.225
 

00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:05.340
 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.840
 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.000
So, I think it's pretty cool and Vayne

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.995
it's because Vayne that everybody knows me and

00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:17.385
when I'm using Vayne she can make me like

00:07:17.385 --> 00:07:19.645
more confident than before.

00:07:19.645 --> 00:07:21.165
So yes, I think it's really cool.

00:07:21.325 --> 00:07:24.605
Uzi, anything to say to the fans?

00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:27.395
 

00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:29.815
 

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:33.225
 

00:07:33.405 --> 00:07:36.655
Thanks for supporting me all the time

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:39.255
and I will do my best in the next game.

00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:42.175
Very good, well thank you so much Uzi for the interview.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.740
Thank you Iris for translating.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.900
For everyone else you can check out my coverage for all things worlds right here on my YouTube channel.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.200
You know what's interesting about vending machines?

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.235
It just makes me think a lot about the choices that we make

00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:55.875
in our life.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.965
You know you're present with an option, where you put some sort of resource in

00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:01.495
and then you're able to acquire something

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:04.165
and there's just rows and row.

00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:05.765
It's just so similar to life

00:08:05.765 --> 00:08:07.825
the different selections you can make

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.640
It also kind of reminds me of champion select.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.780
And you're never sure if you're going to be able to make the right

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.460
selection here.

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:19.625
But, you can be sure you never make the

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:22.215
wrong selection in champion select.

00:08:22.215 --> 00:08:25.215

you'll never lose champ select again!

00:08:32.715 --> 00:08:35.305
and then you'll just be vendering? out wins

00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:37.265
like you can just put some money in a machine

00:08:37.265 --> 00:08:39.820
and then you get the wins.
