00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:07.875
 (LC esports English class translation) At this moment we are here 

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.725
 It’s the final of the Paris midsea season. Now with me is Candice. 

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:14.060
 Or if Yu Yu is good, I am right. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.200
 Let’s talk about this event. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.380
 This interview has you come to witness 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.280
 The first problem is the rest of the frost 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.100
 What do you think about the mid-season itinerary 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.260
 I really like this MSI because 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.020
 This is my first report and interview with MSI. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.740
 Really excited 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.100
 Have you been to Europe before? 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.800
 I have been to the 2016 All-Star Game in Spain. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.980
 I didn't make a mistake. 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.200
 You think this time 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.780
 How do you feel in Berlin and our current Paris game? 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.820
 I think the scene is awesome. 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.600
 Especially the audience here in Paris 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 They will smudge me and don’t know what it means. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.080
 Collective child Ke Ke 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.000
 Not only dirt but also 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.880
 Wang Wang, I don’t know that I just like it. 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.480
 What do you think of the game? 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.540
 Because we have to watch the match between KZ and RNG. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.540
 They have to meet each other and fight the bayonet 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.120
 I think you are sure to be happy now. 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.840
 Because RNG scored the final 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.000
 I hope they can win MSI this time. 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.600
 Because this is the first time ever 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.120
 The five of them know each other very well. 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.760
 Teamwork between teams is also doing well 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:50.960
 The puppy is also gaining momentum. I think this year RNG can do it. 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.480
 Ok, when everyone sees this video they will know if you are right or wrong. 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.200
 So they may feel sorry for you or feel happy for you, I don’t know. 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.040
 Such a long event can sometimes be fun but sometimes it can be exhausting 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.080
 Am I happy about going home? 

00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:10.355
 I am so happy. 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.335
 Because I am a little sick 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.200
 So I want to take a few days off and maybe I can see my boyfriend. 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:30.160
 In addition to my boyfriend, I miss my hometown, like I miss my hometown. I know that I really want Mexican pancakes. 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.080
 I miss my bed, I miss everything. 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.920
 I think my 喵 I have two 喵 I also want my bed, my computer, I don’t have time to play LOL here. 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.920
 Because I don’t have a notebook in Europe, I don’t have a server or an account, so I really miss everything in China. 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.720
 Yeah, that’s too bad. In China, they don’t do special pre-game broadcasts. It’s like the game’s commentary. 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.900
 Because in North America, we have Kobe and Phreak will explain 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.020
 I don't know 诶

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.200
 Maybe they may or may not do it. 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.360
 Let's talk about the rest of the game. RNG reached the final. 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.180
 Is there any team that won you, happy, or which team lost, making you uncomfortable? 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.460
 In fact, I watched the video that you lost in the liquid you made today. 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.900
 I feel sorry for them. Are you tears in your eyes? Is it true tears? 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.180
 (余霜) How do you feel about it (who interviewed) my tears? 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.760
 Yeah, we lost a lot of pain. It’s a fun video. My colleague doesn’t have a strong light. 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.580
 Sorrow and joy, the audience will think if they are serious or just play 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.420
 We like to make the audience unpredictable because the video really feels like both. 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.120
 Because the video you sent today is like the last day of the group match. 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.700
 So I don't want your tears to accompany you for the night. I feel the same. 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.800
 I feel quite sorry about this. 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:22.740
 But RNG beat the barbecue stall on the fourth day of the group match. When it’s not on the roast pig team. 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.840
 I was so shocked that time. 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.220
 Because everyone thinks that RNG has to be killed by KZ. 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.240
 But we are back, I am so proud of them. 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.060
 The team’s wonderful operation is also very eye-catching 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.640
 At the beginning of the group stage, the RNG performance was very different. Win, lose, win, lose, win, win. Yes, we win every game. 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.940
 Very strange, I don’t know why they are like that. 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.520
 Time difference problem, they don't have time.... It's only a day for them to prepare. Right? 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.740
 It’s not easy, so you can go back and go for a few days. What do you want to do? 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:19.740
 Next, we have some projects that I need to host in our summer game and I want to take some shows. 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.420
 - Is it a LOL show? -of course 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.580
 Are you now LOL in addition to working hours? 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.080
 - Yeah. - Very good, I like it. 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:40.380
 Because I really like to fight, I don’t know that some people may play half of their lives. 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.900
 But I really like to play, but my LOL level also has B number in my heart. 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:57.220
 I only have gold 4 now. I still want to practice more. Maybe I can achieve this. I don't know. 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.500
 - Diamond Bar - Diamond? Do you want to drill? I thought you wanted to say platinum but you gave me the diamond directly. 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.600
 I believe that you can drill on it. You just said that you are now gold 4 and behind platinum is that you have to jump two paragraphs. 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.560
 Sister wants to play blind 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:22.040
 - Are you playing wild? - No, but my sister tried to become the strongest player in the wild. 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:30.580
 - What role do you play? - Actually, I didn’t play very well. 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:42.120
 I like to play the wind girl or help me. I can't CARRY my team. 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:49.560
 The problem is coming. I am also the main play assistant. As an assistant, it is always difficult for CARRY to your team. This is a headache. 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.860
 AD is also very tired because it is too hard to take me. 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:04.940
 Good blue, thin, you are now gold 4, then when is platinum? Is this year going to be drilled this year? 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.440
 Let’s go, okay, okay, you said 啥 啥

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:19.960
 I interviewed you last time. In the past six months, more and more fans have floured on Ins and Twitter. 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.700
 How do you see so many Western fans? 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:42.220
 I am very happy. Actually, I don’t know that I am very happy in the West like Europe, North America, there are so many fans. 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.780
 I think they like you very much. Do you have anything to say to these fans? 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:57.920
 I hope they will like me and they will like me more and more year after year. I don't know how to say it. 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.480
 You want them to like you and can continue to like you very well. This is very good. I like this answer. 

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.760
 Thank you for your interest in Travis's channel. Thank you for your attention to the channel of LC E-sports English. Thank you all. 

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.940
 The last thing I wish you a happy birthday - thank you - I know it was yesterday 

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.120
 Thank you so much, you are so good. 

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:37.500
 Why are you still shooting here? Are you waiting for me to sell my Travisgafford channel to the audience to make unscrupulous UP masters? Ke Ke 

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.920
 No need to use us, OK, no lights, you withdraw 

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.080
 let's go
