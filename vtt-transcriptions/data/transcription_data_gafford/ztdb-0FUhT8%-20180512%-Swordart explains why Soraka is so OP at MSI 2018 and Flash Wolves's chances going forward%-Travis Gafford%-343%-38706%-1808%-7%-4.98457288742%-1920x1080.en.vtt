00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.375
 I love to come to Europe, 

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:02.875
 Because we play well every time we come. 

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:03.375
 Because we play well every time we come. 

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:03.875
 Because we play well every time we come. 

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.375
 Every time the lightning wolf comes to Europe, 

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:07.240
 Have won a lot of games against xd 

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:09.295
 Have won a lot of games against xd 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.680
 So I love it very much~ 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.520
 Hey~ this is Travis, I am at the 2018 MSI scene, 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.505
 This is the first day of the event, and I will bring you and everyone to visit. 

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.595
 Next to me is the snake snake Swordart, 

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:26.265
 He has been pretty good today, 

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:29.675
 Snake snake, you just defeated FNC, what do you think of them? 

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:33.535
 Um... I think FNC will play mid and late 

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.535
 Um... I think FNC will play mid and late. 

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:39.985
 They can make a great CALL. 

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:42.955
 Our strength is team battle, 

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:44.735
 So I think 

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:48.125
 If we play pre-game 

00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:52.015
 Can get some advantages, 

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:55.465
 We can easily win the team battle. 

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:58.445
 Then can you talk to us about Solaka? 

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.345
 I remember that you are the Lord E, 

00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:04.365
 This is quite interesting. Can you talk about this style of play? 

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:07.165
 Lord E's Soraka 

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:10.235
 I learned in Korean solo Q, 

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:13.015
 Korean solo Q players will play a lot of different roles. 

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:16.105
 Then Soraka... 

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:19.275
 If she is the main E 

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:22.245
 Can hit the enemy 100%, 

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:25.475
 If the main Q, then it can't 

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:28.545
 Hit every time, so if I 

00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:31.425
 When you are on the line with Magic Ganna, 

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:34.185
 If she is in Q, 

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:36.965
 It will be very dangerous, so 

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:39.975
 I have to stand very late, it is more difficult to lose Q, 

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.155
 Will use E. 

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:45.465
 So when I am on the line with Magic Ganna, I will be Lord E. 

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:48.145
 So what do you think of the current assisted META? 

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.855
 We will see more hands 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.800
 Law hero (like Soraka) 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.925
 Is it raging at MSI? 

00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:58.775
 Um...Soraca is not suitable for every game. 

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:01.845
 There are not many assassins on the opposite side, 

00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:04.835
 It is only suitable if you can't cut the color of the back row. 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.800
 There are not many opportunities to choose Soraka. 

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:09.565
 So I think 

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.195
 Will see more Alexa, 

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:15.885
 Brom, greedy and like. 

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.815
 Sometimes it can be like Magic Gana, 

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:21.055
 Karma, Jenna, Soraka, right. 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.980
 How far do you think this MSI lightning wolf can go? 

00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:31.195
 We are focused on what we see 

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:34.435
 Next game 

00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:37.235
 Just... didn't think too much. 

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:40.015
 I just want to be with my teammates. 

00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:42.725
 Win each game in front of you together. 

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.625
 Then you and your teammates 

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:47.485
 How was your stay in Berlin? 

00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:50.855
 Have you had a good time? What do you think of MSI? 

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:54.245
 We are here 

00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:55.245
 focus on 

00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:58.595
 Practice, so there is not much time 

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.785
 Go out and play. But I think 

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:04.325
 The weather in Berlin is very good. 

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:07.195
 Because Taiwan is sometimes hot, but here 

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:09.825
 I think, um... 

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:17.285
 Hmm... to XD 

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:20.625
 Look, I came from Los Angeles. 

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.655
 It’s sunny, 

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:26.315
 I see this side is cloudy, the sky is dark, 

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:29.035
 I don't really like it here. But do you think it is very good? 

00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:32.075
 Because Taiwan is hot and wet 

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:36.725
 So I think this is much better~ 

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:39.325
 it is good. I always ask professional players every time. 

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:41.705
 What do you think of this city? 

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:44.825
 Whether it is Berlin, China, Shanghai... 

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.595
 Every time they say they want to practice, 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.320
 Nothing is wrong in the city. 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.680
 So this time I want to ask you, what do you think of the hotel and the practice area? 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.980
 Is the environment ok? Do you like it? 

00:03:58.225 --> 00:04:01.045
 Yes, I think it's great here. 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.980
 The restaurant food is delicious, then I like it 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.200
 Come to Europe, because every time the lightning wolf comes to Europe, the results are good XD 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.000
 I have won a lot of games, so I love it very much. 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.700
 So Europe is a lucky place for you? Correct. 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.060
 Anything you want to say to your fans? 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.380
 Anything you want to say to your fans? 

00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:29.065
 Um... because we changed this year. 

00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:31.325
 Many players, 

00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:36.435
 I didn't think we could 

00:04:36.435 --> 00:04:37.745
 How far to go, 

00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:41.195
 But we are practicing very hard, 

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:44.515
 So now there is a 2-0 result. 

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:48.015
 We will continue to work hard, 

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:49.265
 I hope I can, 

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:52.635
 Well, I think this MSI 

00:04:52.635 --> 00:04:53.635
 May not be... 

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:58.115
 Um... It’s a little too difficult to get the championship, but we will try our best. 

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:01.195
 I hope to be in this year's World Finals. 

00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:04.135
 Can perform better. 

00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:06.195
 We will work harder. 

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:08.885
 Great. Thank you, Snake, for accepting my interview. 

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:11.825

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:13.135

00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:16.695
 Every time I come to Europe, this weather 

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:19.805
 It's really incredible. Like today, 

00:05:19.805 --> 00:05:22.935
 These clouds... well, the focus is 

00:05:22.935 --> 00:05:25.765
 I am in Berlin, but this trip is no sponsor. 

00:05:25.765 --> 00:05:28.195
